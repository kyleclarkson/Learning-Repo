    "# Suffix Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation algorithms related to suffix trees (as seen in Gusfield's textbook on String algorithms.)  \n",
    "Assume $S$ is a string of $m$ characters over a fixed a alphabet. We will use the character `$` to denote the end of $S$.  \n",
    "**Note:** To generate our trees in this notebook we will use the `anytree` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **suffix tree** can be described as follows:  \n",
    "1. There are exactly $m$ leaves, one per each character.\n",
    "2. All non-root internal nodes has at least two children.\n",
    "3. Each edge is labeled wiith a non-empty substring of $S$; no two edges out of the same node can have edge-labels starting with the same character. \n",
    "4. For any leaf $i$ the concatenation of the edge-labels on the path from the roof to leaf $i$ speels out the suffix of $S$ that starts at index $i$ (i.e. $S[i:m]$.)\n",
    "5. The last character of $S$ is a terminal character that does not appear else where in $S$.  \n",

    "### Single String Suffix Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by generating a suffix tree for a single input string.\n",
    "First a naive $O(m^2)$ algorithm:  \n",
    "- Insert a single edge with label $S[1:m]$.  \n",
    "- For $i=2, \\ldots m$:  \n",
    "    - insert $S[i:m]$ into the tree.\n",
    "    \n",
    "From the $N_i^{th}$ tree we construct the $N_{i+1}^{th}$ tree by finding the longest path from the root of $N_i$ whose label matches a prefix of $S[i+1:m]$ until no further matches are possible.\n",
    "This path is unique as no two edges out of a node can have labels that begin with the same character.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once this path is found there are two possibilities: we have matched up to a node (say $w$) or we have mateched up to an edge say $(u,v)$.  \n",
    "- If it was an edge, we break the edge into two by inserting an intermediate node $w$; $(u,w)$ contains the sublabel of $(u,v)$ that matched with $S[i+1:m]$ and $(w,v)$ contains the remainder of $(u,v)$.\n",
    "- If it was a node $w$ (either originally or just created) we add a new edge $(w, x)$ to a new leaf $x$ that contains the unmatched part of $S[i+1:m]$.\n"
