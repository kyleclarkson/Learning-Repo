# Wheat Seed Dataset

Dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds#  

Features of three different types of wheat: Kama, Rosa, and Canadian. 70 elements each. 
Xrays were taken of each seed's kernel and the following features were recorded from the xrays:
1. area A,  
2. perimeter P,  
3. compactness C = 4*pi*A/P^2,  
4. length of kernel,  
5. width of kernel,  
6. asymmetry coefficient  
7. length of kernel groove.  
All of these parameters were real-valued continuous.

The dataset can be downloaded as a .txt file where each row contains the 7 feature values, with
the 8th value is either 1, 2, or 3 indicating its class membership. Feature are separated by white space.

TODO:
1. ~~Read data from text file.~~ 
2. ~~Partition data into training and validation sets.~~
3. ~~Create model(s), train.~~
4. ~~Run on validation set.~~
5. ~~Plot results.~~

## Results:

We implemented two neural networks with one and two hidden layers.
The sizes of hidden layers were 40/30 and (128/128 and 40/20) respectively.
Using $L_2$ loss and Adam optimizer, we trained several models which quickly
converged to local optimums. 

Further experimentation with neural networks and other loss functions, or other classification models, are warranted.
