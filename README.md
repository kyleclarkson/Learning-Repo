A repository for learning languages, frameworks and more!


## PyTorch

A directory for learning how to use PyTorch. It is mostly a follow-along of the textbook [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/assets/deep-learning/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf).
## Counterfactual Regret Minimization
---
This directory contains code that is dicussed in Neller's and Lanctot's "[An  Introduction to Counterfactual Regret Minimization](http://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2013/cfr/cfr.pdf)". 
It discusses the idea of **regret** in games, along with how to learn policies to maximize expected utility.
